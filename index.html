            <p class="text-intro">
              The fear is that, as a collapsed airline system is reconstituted,
              similar national self-interest will prevail. Thatâ€™s important
              because the aviation industry is about much more than airline
              health. It is crucial to global communications and trade

              The post-coronavirus chaos will alternatively offer a unique
              opportunity to reframe the foundations of a global airline
              industry. But is there a will to grasp that potential?

            <p class="text-intro">
              If the will is there, finding the right directions will require
              leadership and a recognition that there is no place for
              nationalist attitudes in this most international of all
              industries.

              <strong>Money lose by Airline due to Cronoa Virue</strong>
            </h3>
            <p class="text-intro">
              This scenario applies a similar methodology but to all markets
              that currently have 10 or more confirmed COVID-19 cases (as of 2
              March). The outcome is a 19% loss in worldwide passenger revenues,
              which equates to $113 billion. Financially, that would be on a
              scale equivalent to what the industry experienced in the Global
              Financial Crisis.
